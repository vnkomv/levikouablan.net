## Who am I

My name is Désiré-Lévi Kouablan and I'm a software engineer from the city of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, in Africa. This place is my logbook and where I share my experience and work in my journey toward being an exceptional software engineer. I love to build or participate in building quality products and teams at scale which will make a true difference and, I hope, empower users.


## What I do

I've spend some few years building things, other few running and automating other things. Now, I want to focus on building & running more complex, impactful and bigger software that feel easy to use. And I try to leverage opensource to that.
